abstract: Current articulatory-based three-dimensional source–filter models, which allow the production of vowels and diphtongs, still present very limited expressiveness. Glottal inverse filtering ({GIF}) techniques can become instrumental to identify specific characteristics of both the glottal source signal and the vocal tract transfer function to resemble expressive speech. Several {GIF} methods have been proposed in the literature; however, their comparison becomes difficult due to the lack of common and exhaustive experimental settings. In this work, first, a two-phase analysis methodology for the comparison of {GIF} techniques based on a reference dataset is introduced. Next, state-of-the-art {GIF} techniques based on iterative adaptive inverse filtering ({IAIF}) and quasi closed phase ({QCP}) approaches are thoroughly evaluated on {OPENGLOT}, an open database specifically designed to evaluate {GIF}, computing well-established {GIF} error measures after extending male vowels with their female counterparts. The results show that {GIF} methods obtain better results on male vowels. The {QCP}-based techniques significantly outperform {IAIF}-based methods for almost all error metrics and scenarios and are, at the same time, more stable across sex, phonation type, F0, and vowels. The {IAIF} variants improve the original technique for most error metrics on male vowels, while {QCP} with spectral tilt compensation achieves a lower spectral tilt error for male vowels than the original {QCP}.

A paper banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds
of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.
