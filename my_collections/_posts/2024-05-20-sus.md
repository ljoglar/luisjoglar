My project aims to achieve objective measures of a person's emotional and mental state through voice analysis and processing. This technology could be applied to a system for identifying and assessing emotional well-being in real-time, providing tools for the early detection of emotional and mental disorders, and establishing personalized interventions to improve individuals' mental health.
