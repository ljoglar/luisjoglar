The [Web Audio Conference](https://webaudioconf.com/) is an international conference that congregates the communitty 
interested in pushing further the web audio technologies and their applications. It gathers academic research, artistic 
research, development, design, evaluation and standards concerned with emerging audio-related web technologies such as
Web Audio API, Web RTC, WebSockets and Javascript.

It's been celebrated 8 times since 2015 when it was born in Paris. In 2019 I had the honor of being selected to organise
the 6th edition in the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. Unfortunately, in 2020 the Corona Virus Pandemic hit and we
had to adapt the conference, to make it for the first time online ([web](https://web.archive.org/web/20220327080440/https://webaudioconf2021.com/)).

Luckily, we had the sponsorship of [Gather Town](https://www.gather.town/) where we created a virtual conference room 
where we held the conference. Poster sessions where great as we could walk around the Poster room to see every work exposed 
in each session.

We had the pleasure of having three great key note speakers.


**Anna Xamb√≥** specialised in human-computer interaction and music technology at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, 
and completed her PhD in music computing at The Open University. She gave a great talk her experiences and on network music performance.
