[Essentia.js](https://mtg.github.io/essentia.js/docs/api/) is a Javascript version of the Open Source C++ and Python library for audio information 
developed and maintained by the Music Technology Group (MTG) of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

In 2019 we presented the first prototipe of Essentia.js in the Web Audio Conference 2019 in Trondheim, Norway,
receiving interest and feedback from the web audio community.

In benchmarking comparisons with another javascript library for audio, Meyda, essentia.js showed great results.
You can check replicate the results of the benchmarking in this [website](https://mtg.github.io/essentia.js-benchmarks/)

The development continued and in 2020 2021 we showed the capacities of the javascript library in a workshop on the Web Audio Conference 2021.

The last advancements will be presented in this year's Sonar+D edition.
