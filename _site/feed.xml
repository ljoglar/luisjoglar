Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research" /><category term="Projects" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sonar+d 2020 Workshop</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/04/11/Sonar+D-2020-Workshop.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sonar+d 2020 Workshop" /><published>2022-04-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-04-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/04/11/Sonar+D-2020-Workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/04/11/Sonar+D-2020-Workshop.html"><![CDATA[<p>I had the opportunity to present a workshop in Sónar+D CCCB 2020 about how to use Essentia.js to
automatically detect quality problems in a music collection.

Essentia.js is the port into web technologies of the C++ open-source library Essentia developed and
maintained by the Music Technology Group (MTG) of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.</p>

<p>In general, producers, djs, and audio engineers have to manually control if the audios they work
with have any issues. With this workshop, Sonosuite will show how the open-source Essentia library
can help detect automatically any problems that might exist in the audio tracks. They will also
learn how to control the final results of their work to adequately distribute it to all major
streaming platforms and digital shops.</p>

<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.</p>]]></content><author><name>jill</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.]]></summary></entry></feed>
